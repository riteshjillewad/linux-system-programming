This repository contains **practical assignments, examples, and core concepts** related to **Linux System Programming**.  
It focuses on **low-level interaction with the Linux kernel** using system calls and standard POSIX APIs.

The goal of this repository is to build a **strong foundation in system-level programming**, enabling the development of efficient, robust, and reliable software that works close to the operating system.

## 📌 Topics Covered

- File I/O using system calls (`open`, `read`, `write`, `close`)
- File metadata management (`stat`, `lstat`, `fstat`)
- Directory traversal and file system navigation
- Process-related concepts
- Signal handling and IPC basics
- Error handling and system-level debugging
- Interaction with kernel-managed resources

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

- To understand **how user programs interact with the Linux kernel**
- To practice **writing efficient low-level C programs**
- To gain hands-on experience with **UNIX/Linux internals**
- To support academic coursework and interview preparation in **System Programming**
